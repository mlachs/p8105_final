<p>Ever wondered what parks were most popular around you? This plot
demonstrates some popular visits for recreation visits that people chose
located within NY state. We have identified that the Gateway National
Recreation Area has been the most popular. The two National Monument,
Castle Clinton and Statue of Liberty seems to be a popular destination
as well. The dip in 2012-2013 and 2020 accurately reflects the context
during that time period: the economic recession in 2012-2013 and the
pandemic in 2020 impacted this drop. To see more interesting patterns in
the parks with lower visitation visit, zoom into the smaller range.</p>

<br /> We thought about how people may visit different parks based on
the season! This plot shows the visit rate — the proportion of visitors
each park gets during different seasons. Fire Island NS dominate summer,
reflecting their urban appeal, while quieter parks like Vanderbilt
Mansion NHS draw steady attention across multiple seasons. It’s a
snapshot of how New Yorkers and tourists alike connect with nature
year-round.</p>

<p><br /> Looking at the camping visit rate across parks in NY state, a
notable pattern is the sudden spike in the proportion of summer camping
in 2006. This shift could reflect broader cultural or economic changes
that year, such as increased interest in outdoor recreation or economic
factors encouraging local travel. The summer spike coincides with a
national trend in 2006, where families increasingly turned to camping as
an affordable vacation alternative during economic recession. This
historical moment showcases how external events can shape seasonal
camping behavior.</p>

<br /> We were first curious about how much revenue the Vanderbilt
Mansion, a National Historic Site, generates each year. What I found
instead was a consistent decline in annual revenue over the years,
hinting at a possible drop in visitor interest. The plot shows
occasional peaks, but the overall trend is unmistakably downward. This
raises important questions—are visitor preferences shifting? Is the site
losing visibility? These findings highlights the need for fresh
approaches to reignite public interest in this historic site and ensure
its story continues to resonate with future generations.</p>
